## Company History

Founded on [Wedding Date], Raab Consulting Group began with just two consultants and a dream. Through organic growth (and biology), we've expanded to a full-service consultancy offering expertise that ranges from corporate strategy to why the sky is blue. 

Our commitment to work-life integration is unmatched - we literally live where we work. Over the years, we've developed proprietary methodologies for managing chaos, optimizing routines, and finding creative solutions to problems you didn't know you had.

Today, we serve clients ranging from immediate family members to neighborhood pets, delivering results that consistently exceed expectations (especially the low ones).

## Mission & Values

**Mission:** To provide comprehensive consulting services across an unnecessarily broad spectrum of human experience, from boardroom presentations to bedtime negotiations.

**Values:**
- **Innovation:** If it hasn't been tried, we'll try it (safety not guaranteed)
- **Integrity:** We're honest about what we don't know (which is a lot)
- **Collaboration:** Teamwork makes the dream work (when we're not fighting)
- **Excellence:** We aim for the stars and usually hit the ceiling
- **Family First:** Because we have no choice
