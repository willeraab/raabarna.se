# Development Guide
This is the primary development reference for the Raab Consulting Group website project. Use this for understanding architecture, making structural changes, and planning new features.

## Project Overview
Create a professional-looking, humorous family consultancy website that parodies corporate consulting firms. The site should look legitimate at first glance but become increasingly absurd as visitors explore.

## Family Information
- **Wilhelm**: Chief Executive Consultant
- **Nina**: Managing Director of Operations
- **Gabriel**: Senior Technology Advisor
- **Linn√©a**: Creative Director
- **Vendela** (Twin): Director of Snack Operations & Logistics
- **Vidar** (Twin): Director of Chaos Coordination & Sound Engineering

Note: While Vendela and Vidar have separate roles, they are 4-year-old twins who both attend preschool (graduating 2027) and share the Twin Studies Institute education. Their services are complementary but distinct.

**Content Reference:** All consultant bios, service descriptions, case studies, and other copy are documented in [CONTENT.md](CONTENT.md).

## Technical Requirements
