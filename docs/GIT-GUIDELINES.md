# Git Guidelines

## Commit Message Format
When creating git commits for this project, follow these guidelines:

**IMPORTANT: Never include references to AI assistants, Claude, Claude Code, or any automated tools in commit messages.**

- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what changed and why
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`)
- Focus on the technical changes, not who or what made them
- Keep messages professional and human-focused

**Good examples:**
- `feat: add responsive navigation menu`
- `fix: resolve TypeScript build configuration error`
- `docs: update project setup instructions`
- `refactor: simplify consultant card component`

**Bad examples (NEVER do this):**
- ❌ Any message mentioning Claude, AI, or usage of automated tools
- ❌ Any Co-Authored-By lines referencing AI assistants
- ❌ Any footer text about code generation tools

## Co-Authorship
- Only include Co-Authored-By for actual human contributors
- Never add automated tool attributions to commits
